# Campaign URL Builder

This URL builder tool is designed in the same vein as this https://ga-dev-tools.web.app/campaign-url-builder/ but with some more "enterprise" grade features:

1. Ability to create multiple url "campaigns" with additional custom parameters to cover more extensive analytics based campaigns in bulk.
2. Ability to export created campaigns to a CSV file.

Things I'm working on:

1. Converting to Typescript
2. Jest/RTL tests
